Bangladesh,Extremely dense cities and limited early testing drove steady community spread after the nationwide shutdown of March to May 2020.
Belgium,Early outbreaks in March 2020 swept nursing homes and produced one of Europe’s highest death rates; restrictions eased in summer but had to be reimposed during the rising autumn wave.
Canada,"Provincial lockdowns in spring 2020 controlled the first wave, but gradual reopening led to rising cases from September through early November."
Costa Rica,"Early border closures held numbers low until borders reopened in July 2020, after which cases climbed sharply from August to October."

Singapore,"Aggressive testing and tracing contained community spread, though large dormitory outbreaks from April to May 2020 accounted for most cases; daily new cases were in single digits by November."
